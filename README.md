This program helps backing up data to dropbox easier and automated. It first uploads your files to dropbox and then 
deletes them from the local storage. It uses input for the path to 'delete files from' and the dropbox path to upload the 
file to. It also sends an email from the specified email address to your specified email address as a confirmation 
using a secure ssl server . The program also creates and appends to a log file, which stores the time of the instances 
the backups were done.
